# Discord-Antiscam-Links

## How To Use
If you are using a Command Handler all you have to do is place what I have in my Index.js  into your main index.js file not the one under handler. Next make a file called scam.json copy all of the links in my scam.json into yours and you're done.

Same goes for a regular bot with no Command Handler just place it in your index.js


If you have any questions feel free to leave an issue and I will respond as soon as I can :)
